About:

RepoCrawler, is to open up a codebase repository, look through necessary files, create notes and keywords to search for each component, map everything, and then we will create a functional UI to be able to query questions about what it does, how to operate it, etc

Action Plan for Repository Analysis

Define File Relevance Criteria:
-Determine which file types are relevant (e.g., .py, .js).
-Define exclusion criteria for files that typically don't contain useful code or comments (e.g., binary files, configuration files like .json and .yaml unless they are part of the functionality, etc.).

Develop File Parsing Mechanism:
-Implement functionality in the filehandling module to traverse directories and identify relevant files.
-Use regex or similar methods to filter files based on the defined criteria.

Integrate AI for Code Summarization:
-Utilize an AI service (like OpenAI Codex or your own trained model) to generate summaries for the contents of each file.
-Ensure you handle rate limits and optimize API calls for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Keyword Extraction:
-Develop methods in the analysis module to extract keywords from both the code and its AI-generated summaries.
-Consider natural language processing (NLP) techniques to refine keyword extraction and relevance.

Dependency and Import Mapping:
-Analyze import statements in code files to map dependencies and file connections.
-Implement graph-based structures in the mapping module to visualize and store these relationships.

Generate Helper Files:
-Design a system to create and save helper files with keywords, summaries, and dependency maps.
-Ensure these files are easily accessible and organized logically within the data directory.

User Interface for Analysis Results:
-Update the ui module to display summaries, keywords, and maps within the application.
-Provide interactive elements to explore different components of the analysis.

Handling Large Repositories:
-Implement asynchronous processing to handle large repositories without blocking the main UI.
-Use progress indicators to provide feedback during long-running operations.

Optimization and Testing:
-Continuously test the system with different types of repositories to ensure robustness and reliability.
-Optimize the code for performance, especially when dealing with large and complex repositories.

Documentation and Help System:
-Document how to use the analysis features and interpret the results.
-Provide in-app guidance or tooltips to help users navigate the analysis results.
