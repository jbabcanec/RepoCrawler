Keywords: High-level functionalities:
- The code imports necessary libraries, including PyQt5 for creating GUI applications.
- The code creates a MainController class, which is responsible for managing the flow of the application and connecting different components.
- The code reads an API key from a credentials file and uses it to create an instance of the GPTTurboProcessor class, which is used to process user inputs and generate itineraries.
- The code creates instances of three different classes: InitQuestions, GPSPanel, and FinalChecklist. These classes represent different panels in the application and handle user inputs and data collection.
- The code connects signals from the different panels to corresponding handlers in the MainController class.
- The code collects user inputs from the different panels and
